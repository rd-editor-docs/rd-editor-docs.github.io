# Surgery
<h3 className="subtitle" They did surgery on an rdlevel></h3>

With the basics of the level editor, there are some hidden ways to edit a level as well. An .rdlevel file can be opened in a text editor to make changes to the level that couldn't be made otherwise currently.

## Characters
One of the categories in the rdlevel file is called rows and will have a similar format to this:

You can edit the character name into any of the following characters (characters not available by default may have unfinished animations)

- Bodybuilder
- SamuraiBoss
- Paige
- Politician
- Miner

## Settings and Mods
At the top of the rdlevel file you can add mods to your level to make it behave slightly differently.

![Entries for settings in the .rdlevel file](/img/advanced-techniques/settings_rdlevel.png)

The list of mods that can be used are:

| Mod | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| noSmartJudgement | Changes hit timing rules - makes it so if you miss a note late enough that it's a hit for the next note, it's still a miss for the first. |
| adaptRowsToRoomHeight | Automatically move rows closer or further apart when the room size changes. |
| noDoublePulse | No special double/triple pulse animations. |
| showHitStripOnlyOnActiveBeats | Hitstrip only appears in rooms where there are active beats. |
| smoothShake | Replaces screen shakes with a smooth version. |
| rotateShake | Replaces screen shakes with a rotation shake. |
| wobblyLines | Oneshots turn wobbly, and wobble when hit. |
| bombBeats | Freetimes that start on a hit will be bombs and miss on hit. |
| disableRowChangeWarningFlashes | Disables row change warning flashes when changing a row from CPU or another player. |
| noOneshotShadows | Removes the aftereffect on short oneshots. |
| startImmediately | Immediately starts the level without waiting for the player to press a button. |

Another setting changeable through surgery is `firstBeatBehavior`, which by default is `RunNormally`. You can change this to `RunEventsOnPrebar` to make any action events on bar 1 beat 1 happen before the level starts.
