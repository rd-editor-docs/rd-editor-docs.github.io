# Set Play Style
Setting the play style allows you to change the behaviour of the playhead (the scrolling white line on the timeline). Note that changing the play style **will not** change the behaviour of the music. The music will continue playing as if the play style did not change. 

There are 6 possible play styles: Normal, Loop, LoopBeatsOnly, Prolong, Immediately, and ExtraImmediately.

:::danger
Do not loop or jump to bar 1, this will cause issues.
:::

## Normal

Ths is the default behaviour. The playhead advances through bars in sequential order.

## Loop
This causes the playhead to restart the current bar upon reaching the end of the current bar. This will repeat until the play style is changed to something else.

## LoopBeatsOnly
This causes the playhead to restart the current bar upon reaching the end of the current bar, but subsequent times only plays the beats (i.e. without the vfx).

## Prolong
This causes the playhead to stop at the end of the current bar until the play style is changed to something else. The game **will wait for the end of a bar** (music-wise) before changing the play style away from Prolong in order to maintain sync.

*The playhead will remain here until the play style is changed.*

Note that since the playhead no longer moves, **you will get stuck** unless you have a conditional that eventually triggers and changes the play style.

Using the `activeDialogues` mod automatically sets the play style to Prolong, which lets dialogue remain on screen until user input is received.

## Immediately
This causes the playhead to jump to another bar **after a prebar of approximately 667ms**. The absolute bar number can be given, or a relative bar number from the current bar can be given instead.

Unlike the `SetNextBar()` custom method, this event can be executed in the middle of a bar (or even the middle of a beat).

This will almost certainly cause your level to desync from the music, as the jump is performed immediately after the prebar delay ends. This can be remedied with some planning.


## ExtraImmediately
This is similar to Immediately, but causes the playhead to jump to another bar quicker, with **a delay of approximately 300ms**.

This will also almost certainly cause your level to desync from the music.
